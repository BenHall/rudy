# = Rudy
# 
# This is an example Rudy configuration.
#
# Rudy automatically looks for configuration files in the 
# following locations (in this order):
#
#     ./.rudy/config
#     ~/.rudy/config
#
#     ./Rudyfile
#     ./config/rudy/*.rb
#     ./.rudy/*.rb
#     /etc/rudy/*.rb
#
# When multuple files are found, the configuration is 
# NOT OVERRIDDEN. It's ADDED / APPENDED. This means you can 
# split configuration across many files as you please. 
#
# There are three sections: accounts, defaults, machines, and routines.
# 
# By convention, accounts and defaults go in ~/.rudy/config or ./.rudy/config 
# machines and routines configuration goes in ./Rudyfile or 
# ./config/rudy/machines.rb and ./config/rudy/routines.rb
#

# ---------------------------------------------------------  MACHINES  --------
# The machines block describes the "physical" characteristics
# of your environments. 
machines do
  
  users do
    # If you already have private keys for logging in to your EC2 instances
    # EC2 instances you can specify them here and Rudy will use these instead.

  # We've defined an environment called "stage" with one role: "app". 
  # The configuration inside the env block is available to all its 
  # roles. The configuration inside the role blocks is available only
  # to machines in that specific role.

  # those scripts in the form of a yaml file. The file is called
  # rudy-config.yml.

# ----------------------------------------------------------- ROUTINES --------
# The routines block describes the repeatable processes for each machine group.

          # it, gives it a filesystem, and mounts it. 
          #create "/rudy/disk1"
        end
        # You can execute a shell command on each instance after
        # it's created. This touch command will run as root.

      end
      
    end

# ----------------------------------------------------------- COMMANDS --------
# The commands block defines shell commands to be allowed or disallowed. These
# shells commands are the ones available in routine blocks. The default list is
# defined by Rye::Cmd. 
commands do
  allow :mongrel_rails
  disallow :ps
