# Rudyfile -- An example Rudy configuration. 
#
#
# Rudy automatically looks for configuration files in the 
# following locations:
#
#     ~/.rudy/config
#     ./.rudy/config
#     /etc/rudy/*.rb
#     ./.rudy/*.rb
#     ./Rudyfile
#     ./config/rudy/*.rb
#
# When multuple files are found, the configuration is 
# NOT OVERRIDDEN. It's ADDED / APPENDED. This means you can 
# split configuration across many files as you please. 
#
# There are three sections: accounts, defaults, machines. 
# By convention, accounts and defaults go in ~/.rudy/config or ./.rudy/config 
# We encourage this to help avoid checking in AWS keys into source control.


# ---------------------------------------------------------  MACHINES  --------
# The machines block describes the "physical" characteristics
# of your environments.
