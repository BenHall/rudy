# Rudyfile -- An example Rudy configuration. 
#
#
# Rudy automatically looks for configuration files in the 
# following locations:
#
#     ~/.rudy/config
#     ./.rudy/config
#     /etc/rudy/*.rb
#     ./.rudy/*.rb
#     ./Rudyfile
#     ./config/rudy/*.rb
#     ./*.rudy
#
# When multuple files are found, the configuration is 
# NOT OVERRIDDEN. It's ADDED / APPEND. This means you can split 
# configuration across many files as you please. 
#
# There are four sections: awsinfo, defaults, machines, routines. 
# By convention, awsinfo and defaults go in ~/.rudy/config or ./.rudy/config 
# We encourage this to help avoid checking in AWS keys into source control.


# ---------------------------------------------------------  MACHINES  --------
# The machines block describes the "physical" characteristics
# of your environments. 
machines do
  env :stage do
    
    role :app do 
      disks do  
        path "/rudy/example1" do
          size 4
          device "/dev/sdr"
        end
        path "/rudy/example2" do
          size 5  # This will be ignored when restoring from a snapshot
          device "/dev/sdm"
        end
      end
    end

  end
end

# -------------------------------------------------------  ROUTINES  --------
# The routines block describe processes for each machine group. 
routines do
  
  env :stage do
    role :app do
      
      shutdown do 
        before :root => "echo 'BEFORE' && pwd"
        disks do
          destroy "/rudy/example1"
          destroy "/rudy/example2"
        end
      end
      
      startup do
        disks do
          create "/rudy/example1" do
            device "/dev/sdl"
          end
          create "/rudy/example2"
        end
        
        after :root => "pwd"
        after :rudy => "pwd"
      end
      
      restart do 
        before :root => "pwd"
        after :root => "pwd"
        after :rudy => "pwd"
        
        disks do
          mount "/rudy/example1"
          mount "/rudy/example2"
        end
      end
      
    end
  end
