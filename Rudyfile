# = Rudy -- Skeleton configuration
# 
# Rudy automatically looks for configuration files in the following 
# locations (in this order):
#
#     ./.rudy/config
#     ~/.rudy/config
#
#     ~/.rudy/*.rb
#     ./Rudyfile
#     ./machines.rb, ./routines.rb, ./commands.rb
#     ./config/rudy/*.rb
#     ./.rudy/*.rb
#     /etc/rudy/*.rb
#
# When multuple files are found, the configuration is NOT OVERRIDDEN,
# it's ADDED or APPENDED depending on context. This means you can split 
# configuration across many files as you please. 
#
# There are five sections: accounts, defaults, machines, commands and routines.
# 
# By convention, accounts go in ./.rudy/config or ~/.rudy/config 
# machines, commands, routines, and defaults configuration go in ./Rudyfile or  
# into separate files in ./.rudy or ./config/rudy (machines.rb, commands.rb, ...)
