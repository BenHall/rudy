# = Rudy
# 
# This is an example Rudy configuration.
#
# Rudy automatically looks for configuration files in the 
# following locations (in this order):
#
#     ~/.rudy/config
#     ./.rudy/config
#
#     ./Rudyfile
#     ./config/rudy/*.rb
#     ./.rudy/*.rb
#     /etc/rudy/*.rb
#
# When multuple files are found, the configuration is 
# NOT OVERRIDDEN. It's ADDED / APPENDED. This means you can 
# split configuration across many files as you please. 
#
# There are three sections: accounts, defaults, machines. 
# 
# By convention, accounts and defaults go in ~/.rudy/config or ./.rudy/config 
# machines configuration goes in ./Rudyfile or ./config/rudy/machines.rb
