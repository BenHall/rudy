# Rudyfile -- An example Rudy configuration. 
#
#
# Rudy automatically looks for configuration files in the 
# following locations:
#
#     ~/.rudy/config
#     ./.rudy/config
#
#     /etc/rudy/*.rb
#     ./.rudy/*.rb
#     ./Rudyfile
#     ./config/rudy/*.rb
#
# When multuple files are found, the configuration is 
# NOT OVERRIDDEN. It's ADDED / APPENDED. This means you can 
# split configuration across many files as you please. 
#
# There are three sections: accounts, defaults, machines. 
# By convention, accounts and defaults go in ~/.rudy/config or ./.rudy/config 
# machines configuration goes in ./Rudyfile or ./config/rudy/machines.rb


# ---------------------------------------------------------  MACHINES  --------
# The machines block describes the "physical" characteristics
# of your environments. 
machines do
  env :rudydev do
    role :app do
              
      disks do
        path "/rudy/example1" do
          size 4
          device "/dev/sdr"
        end
        path "/rudy/example2" do
          size 5 # Ignored when restoring from a snapshot
          device "/dev/sdm"
        end
      end
      
    end
  end
end
