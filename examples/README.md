# Rudy Configuration Examples


## Contributions

I'm very open to contributions! Rudy supports all Linux-based platforms (with partial Solaris support) and software (rails, sinatra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc...) so it's possible to write examples for pretty much anything. If you're interested in writing new examples, I'll gladly accept them and include them here (with credit of course!).
